This project is for my compagny but I'm keeping the code open for everybody that want to make a supervision for some PLC or other things.

I'm ask to build a longterm database for the production of some machines.
I'm planning on using Node-RED to extract some data from a siemens PLC, with the help of the module snap7 (still in testing and waiting for ressources).
I'm using a previous code made to display some information on a website, the code is kinda all over the place because I'm doing a lot of testing with a lot of differents APIs and fonctionnnalities.

The core of the project is done with Nodejs, Express, EJS and MySql.

I'm actually banging my head against the walls to connect the database to the website. The database has some random datas in it that I want to extract and put in graphics.

Any help is welcome.
